# openui5-masonry

openui5-masonry is a OpenUI5 wrapper of MasonryJS. Masonry is a JavaScript grid layout library. It works by placing elements in optimal position based on available vertical space, sort of like a mason fitting stones in a wall. Youâ€™ve probably seen it in use all over the Internet.

# Importa Note

This is just a first commit to show early work stage of the wrapper library.
More updates are coming in the next week so be patient ;)

# TODO

- Add more demo
- Full documentation coverage
- Create a real README :D
- Add all methods/events
